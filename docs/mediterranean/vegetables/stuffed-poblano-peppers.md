## Ingredients

### Dairy
- ½ cup 2% Mexican blend cheese, shredded

### Grains
- ½ cup uncooked brown rice

### Vegetables
- 4 large poblano peppers
- 1 ½ cups Fresh Grilled Salsa or other low-sodium salsa
- 1 15-ounce can black beans
- 1 ½ cup frozen corn

### Oil & Spices
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook rice according to package instructions.

2. Slice each poblano pepper in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs.

3. Place the peppers in a baking dish skin side up. Broil for 3-5 minutes and then flip over the peppers and broil 3-5 minutes longer. Watch the pepper closely to make sure they only char and don’t overly burn.

4. Drain and rinse the black beans. In a large, microwave safe bowl, combine the beans, salsa, corn, a quarter cup of cheese, cumin, chili powder, and cayenne. Add pepper to taste. Heat the filling for about 2-3 minutes in the microwave, or until warm, stirring after each 30 second increment. Stir in the rice.

5. Spoon the filling into each pepper half. Top with the remaining cheese and broil until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
